              <h4>Impact of Oxidative Stress on Male Infertility</h4>
              <p>
                Research has shown. 30-40% of male infertility is caused by OS. OS can cause a decrease in the hormones that are responsible for sperm
                production (low sperm count) and appearance (immature/abnormal sperm) OS can also damage the sperm, rendering them dormant/inactive.
                The sperm loses it's ability to swim to the egg in the woman (poor sperm quality). Thus the sperm lacks fertilization potential.

          <h4>Little Interesting Story From Our User</h4>
          <p>
            From a Cellgevity user, I got married 2010 and in 2011 I was diagnosed with multiple fibroids. I was really afraid of surgery because
            people advised me against it. I have used so many supplements both made at home and abroad and none worked, that was the reason I didn't
            buy the idea of cellgevity when my friend told me about it. I did fibroid surgery in 2017, immediately after that I started praying to
            conceive, then in one of my praying sessions I heard a voice that said to me ''Try Cellgevity'' so immediately after the prayer I started
            reading more about cellgevity and after which I decided that I am going to give it a trial. God directed me to this Angel Mrs. Nkiruka
            Ezima who bought and sent cellgevity to me. I started taking cellgevity on 16th December while I was on my monthly cycle, and was
            confirmed pregnant on 15th of January this year after both private and NHS hospitals in UK told me that I can only conceive through IVF.
            Today I have a bouncing baby boy to call mine, what a mighty God we serve. <span>#CellgevityWorks</span>
